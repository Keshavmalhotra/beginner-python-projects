These two mini projects were created as part of my journey learning Python programming. Both projects helped me practice essential programming concepts including input handling, loops, conditionals, error management, and working with external libraries.

Guess the Number Game
A simple interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within an increasing range. Correct guesses earn points, and as the player levels up, the difficulty increases by expanding the range and required points. The game validates user inputs, handles invalid or negative entries, and exits gracefully when no input is provided.

Password Generator
This utility generates secure random passwords based on user preferences: number of letters, numbers, and symbols. It includes input validation to ensure meaningful passwords, supports the option for an uppercase first character, and copies the generated password to the clipboard automatically. It also prevents invalid configurations such as passwords made up only of symbols or too short/long passwords.

Both projects reflect my hands-on learning approach, solidifying my understanding of Python fundamentals and practical coding skills.
