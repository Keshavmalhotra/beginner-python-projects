# Python Learning Projects

These are three beginner-level Python projects created while learning the language.  
Each one helped build a better understanding of logic, input handling, file system interaction, and core Python libraries.

## 1. Password Generator

**Description:**  
A customizable password generator that asks the user how many:
- Letters
- Numbers
- Symbols  
...to include, and whether the first character should be uppercase. The generated password is automatically copied to the clipboard.

**Purpose:**  
Practices:
- User input validation  
- Random selection using `random`  
- Clipboard copying with `pyperclip`  
- Loop and condition control

## 2. Guess the Number – Mini Game

**Description:**  
A terminal-based number guessing game with leveling mechanics. You gain points by guessing the correct number. Levels increase difficulty by expanding the guessing range and required points.

**Purpose:**  
Practices:
- `while` loops and control flow  
- `random` number generation  
- Game logic and state management  
- Handling invalid input and progression systems

## 3. Temp Folder Cleaner

**Description:**  
A script that deletes contents of system temp folders.  
It skips files that raise permission errors or are currently in use.  
⚠️ *This is still being improved, and may not fully work in all cases yet.*

**Purpose:**  
Practices:
- Environment variable access with `os.environ`  
- Folder deletion using `shutil.rmtree`  
- Error handling for file access and permissions
